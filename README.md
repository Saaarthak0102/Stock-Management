## Introduction  
The **Stock Management System** is a mini-project developed using C language. This project simulates a basic inventory management system and serves as an excellent learning tool for beginners aiming to understand file handling and basic C programming constructs.

---

## Project Objectives  
- Efficiently manage stock data for a business.  
- Provide real-time inventory updates.  
- Simplify stock search and tracking processes.  
- Log stock activities for audit and analysis purposes.

---

## System Requirements  
- A system capable of running C programs (Linux/Windows).  
- GCC compiler or any compatible C compiler.  

---

## Project Structure  
The project consists of the following components:  
- **Main Data File (`NextFile.txt`)**: Stores stock item details (product name, ID, quantity, price, etc.).  
- **Bill File (`bill.txt`)**: Records details of bills generated after purchases.  
- **Activity Log File (`activity_log.txt`)**: Logs actions performed on stock items.  
- **Purchase Log File (`purchase_log.txt`)**: Keeps track of purchase transactions.  

---

## File Descriptions  
1. **NextFile.txt**: Contains the main inventory data, updated dynamically as operations are performed.  
2. **bill.txt**: Stores generated bills for future reference and tracking.  
3. **activity_log.txt**: Logs all major activities such as stock additions, deletions, and updates.  
4. **purchase_log.txt**: Captures details of purchase operations.  

---

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.  
2. Compile the `Stock Management System` code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc main.c -o stock_management`).  
3. Run the executable file to start the program.

## Usage  
1. **Login**: Authenticate to access the system.  
2. **Menu Options**:  
   - Add, update, or delete stock items.  
   - Search for products by name or ID.  
   - Generate bills for purchases.  
   - View logs for auditing.  
3. Follow on-screen instructions for seamless navigation.

## Code Structure  
The project structure and key functions are outlined below:  
- **Core Files**:  
  - `main.c`: Contains the core logic and function calls.  
- **Functions**:  
  - `wel_come()`: Displays the welcome screen.  
  - `login()`: Handles user authentication.  
  - `menu()`: Provides menu options to the user.  
  - `add_item()`, `edit_item()`, `deleteproduct()`: Manage stock items.  
  - `search_item()`: Search for stock by name or ID.  
  - `view_activity_log()`, `log_activity()`: Handle activity logs.  
  - `purchase_item()`: Manage stock purchases.
